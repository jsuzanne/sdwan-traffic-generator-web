# 🤖 Generate IoT Device Profiles with LLM

## Overview

Instead of manually creating IoT device configurations, use an LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to generate realistic, context-aware device profiles for your SD-WAN Traffic Generator demos and labs.

This approach allows you to quickly create industry-specific device topologies with proper DHCP fingerprints, vendor diversity, and realistic traffic patterns.

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt Template

Copy the prompt template from `iot/IOT_PROMPT.txt` or use this condensed version:

```text
I need you to generate an iot-devices.json file for my SD-WAN Traffic Generator app.

Context:
- Client: [CLIENT_NAME - e.g., Suez, Schneider Electric, Hospital XYZ]
- Industry: [INDUSTRY - e.g., Water/Energy Utilities, Healthcare, Manufacturing]
- Use case: [USE_CASE - e.g., Palo Alto IoT Security demo, Prisma Access validation]
- Number of devices: [NUMBER - e.g., 50-100 devices]

Requirements:
1. Generate a diverse mix of IoT device types relevant to this industry
2. Include realistic vendor names (Hikvision, Axis, Philips, Sonoff, TP-Link, Xiaomi, etc.)
3. Each device must have a unique MAC address following vendor OUI patterns
4. Include DHCP fingerprints for accurate device identification by Prisma IoT Security
5. Assign appropriate protocols per device type
6. Use realistic hostnames and vendor_class_id values per vendor
7. Vary traffic_interval between 60-300 seconds for realism
8. Use IP addresses in the 192.168.207.X range starting from .50

Output format: Return ONLY valid JSON with complete DHCP fingerprints.
```


**Output format: Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema:**

```json
{
  "network": {
    "gateway": "192.168.207.1"
  },
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "vendor_devicetype_01",
      "name": "Device Model Name",
      "vendor": "Vendor Name",
      "type": "Device Category",
      "mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff",
      "ip_start": "192.168.207.50",
      "protocols": ["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "cloud", "dns"],
      "enabled": true,
      "traffic_interval": 180,
      "description": "Vendor Device Model Name - Device Category",
      "fingerprint": {
        "dhcp": {
          "hostname": "device-hostname",
          "vendor_class_id": "Vendor Device Model",
          "client_id_type": 1,
          "param_req_list": [1, 3, 6, 15, 28, 51, 58, 59]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reference Example

Copy this structure exactly:

```json
{
  "id": "hikvis_security_cameras_01",
  "name": "Hikvision DS-2CD2385FWD-I",
  "vendor": "Hikvision",
  "type": "Security Camera",
  "mac": "00:12:34:14:00:14",
  "ip_start": "192.168.207.70",
  "protocols": ["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "rtsp", "cloud", "dns", "ntp"],
  "enabled": true,
  "traffic_interval": 242,
  "description": "Hikvision DS-2CD2385FWD-I - Security Cameras",
  "fingerprint": {
    "dhcp": {
      "hostname": "DS-2CD2385FWD-I",
      "vendor_class_id": "HIKVISION",
      "client_id_type": 1,
      "param_req_list": [1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 28, 42, 51, 54, 58, 59]
    }
  }
}
```

### Protocol Assignments by Device Type

- **Cameras** → `["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "rtsp", "cloud", "dns", "ntp"]`
- **Sensors** → `["dhcp", "arp", "mqtt", "cloud", "dns"]`
- **Smart Lighting** → `["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "cloud", "dns"]`
- **Printers** → `["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "mdns", "dns"]`
- **Thermostats** → `["dhcp", "arp", "http", "cloud", "dns", "ntp"]`

### DHCP Fingerprint Guidelines

**Cameras** (Hikvision, Axis, Dahua):
```json
"param_req_list": [1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 28, 42, 51, 54, 58, 59]
```
*(includes NTP option 42)*

**Smart Lighting** (Philips Hue, LIFX, TP-Link):
```json
"param_req_list": [1, 3, 6, 15, 28, 51, 58, 59]
```
or with NTP:
```json
"param_req_list": [1, 3, 6, 15, 28, 42, 51, 58, 59]
```

**Sensors** (Xiaomi, Aqara, Samsung):

2. Wait for the LLM to generate the complete JSON
3. Copy the generated JSON output

### Step 4: Import into Your App

1. Open your SD-WAN Traffic Generator dashboard
2. Navigate to the **IoT Tab**
3. Click **Import**
4. Paste the JSON into the import field
5. Click **Validate** to check syntax

## Validation and Testing

After generating your JSON file, validate it before importing:

### 1. JSON Syntax Validation

```bash
# Install jq if not already installed
# macOS: brew install jq
# Linux: apt-get install jq

# Validate JSON syntax
jq . iot-devices.json
```

### 2. Check for Duplicate MAC Addresses

```bash
# List all MACs and find duplicates
jq -r '.devices[].mac' iot-devices.json | sort | uniq -d

# If output is empty, no duplicates ✅
```

### 3. Verify All Devices Have Fingerprints

```bash
# List devices missing DHCP fingerprints
jq -r '.devices[] | select(.fingerprint.dhcp == null) | .id' iot-devices.json

# If output is empty, all devices have fingerprints ✅
```

### 4. Check IP Address Range

```bash
# List all IPs to verify they're in correct range
jq -r '.devices[].ip_start' iot-devices.json | sort -V

# Should be sequential from 192.168.207.50 onwards
```

### 5. Verify Protocol Assignments

```bash
# List devices by type and their protocols
jq -r '.devices[] | "\(.type): \(.protocols | join(", "))"' iot-devices.json | sort -u
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific About Industry Context

The more details you provide, the better the LLM can select appropriate devices:

❌ **Too vague:** "Generate 50 devices"  
✅ **Better:** "Generate 50 devices for a water utility company including SCADA, meters, and sensors"

### 2. Request Vendor Diversity

Mix premium and budget brands for realism:

```text
Include a mix of:
- Premium vendors (Axis cameras, Philips lighting, GE Healthcare)
- Mid-range vendors (TP-Link, Ubiquiti, Dahua)
- Budget IoT (Sonoff, Xiaomi, Shelly)
```

### 3. Specify Realistic Quantities

Per device type, suggest realistic counts:

```text
- 3-5 Hikvision cameras for parking/lobby
- 10-15 Philips Hue lights across floors
- 20-30 Xiaomi sensors (doors, motion, temperature)
- 2-3 HP printers per floor
```

### 4. Use OUI Patterns

The prompt includes correct MAC OUI prefixes, but you can emphasize:

```text
Ensure MAC addresses use correct vendor OUI prefixes:
- Philips devices must start with ec:b5:fa
- Hikvision must start with 00:12:34
- TP-Link must start with 50:c7:bf
```

### 5. Iterate and Refine

If the first generation isn't perfect:

```text
The output looks good, but please:
- Replace all Xiaomi sensors with Aqara (same OUI: 54:ef:44)
- Add 5 more Axis cameras (OUI: 00:40:8c)
- Reduce TP-Link bulbs from 15 to 8
```

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Duplicate MAC Addresses

**Solution:** Ask the LLM to regenerate with:

```text
Please ensure all MAC addresses are unique. Use sequential addresses within each vendor's OUI range.
```

### Issue: Unrealistic Device Mix

**Solution:** Provide more specific counts:

```text
Generate exactly:
- 10 cameras
- 20 sensors
- 15 smart lights
- 10 smart plugs
- 5 thermostats
```

### Issue: Missing Fingerprints

**Solution:** Emphasize in prompt:

```text
CRITICAL: Every device MUST include a complete fingerprint.dhcp object with hostname, vendor_class_id, and param_req_list.
```

### Issue: Wrong Protocols

**Solution:** Specify protocols per type:

```text
Cameras MUST have: dhcp, arp, lldp, http, rtsp, cloud, dns, ntp
Sensors MUST have: dhcp, arp, mqtt, cloud, dns
Do not add protocols that are not supported (snmp, https).
```

## LLM Provider Comparison

| Provider | Best For | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| ChatGPT (GPT-4) | General use | Fast, reliable JSON output | Can occasionally miss fingerprint details |
| Claude (Sonnet) | Complex configs | Excellent at following detailed instructions | Slower for large configs |
| Gemini | Quick iterations | Good for rapid prototyping | May need more guidance on fingerprints |

**Recommendation:** Start with ChatGPT GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet 3.5.

## Integration with Dashboard

### Option 1: External Generation (Current)

```text
User → LLM (ChatGPT/Claude) → Copy JSON → Import to Dashboard
```

**Pros:** Simple, no API costs, works today  
**Cons:** Manual copy/paste step

### Option 2: Future API Integration

```typescript
// Future enhancement: direct LLM integration
const generateConfig = async (prompt: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/generate-devices', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt })
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

**Pros:** Seamless UX  
**Cons:** Requires API keys, costs per generation
