# 🤖 Generate IoT Device Profiles with LLM

## Overview

Instead of manually creating IoT device configurations, use an LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to generate realistic, context-aware device profiles for your SD-WAN Traffic Generator demos and labs.

This approach allows you to quickly create industry-specific device topologies with proper DHCP fingerprints, vendor diversity, and realistic traffic patterns.

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Copy the Prompt Template

Copy the prompt template below and paste it into your preferred LLM:

I need you to generate an iot-devices.json file for my SD-WAN Traffic Generator app.

Context:

Client: [CLIENT_NAME - e.g., Suez, Schneider Electric, Hospital XYZ]

Industry: [INDUSTRY - e.g., Water/Energy Utilities, Healthcare, Manufacturing]

Use case: [USE_CASE - e.g., Palo Alto IoT Security demo, Prisma Access validation]

Number of devices: [NUMBER - e.g., 50-100 devices]

Requirements:

Generate a diverse mix of IoT device types relevant to this industry

Include realistic vendor names (Hikvision, Axis, Philips, Sonoff, TP-Link, Xiaomi, etc.)

Each device must have a unique MAC address following vendor OUI patterns

Include DHCP fingerprints for accurate device identification by Prisma IoT Security

Assign appropriate protocols per device type:

Cameras → dhcp, arp, lldp, http, rtsp, cloud, dns, ntp

Sensors → dhcp, arp, mqtt, cloud, dns

Smart Lighting → dhcp, arp, lldp, http, cloud, dns

Printers → dhcp, arp, lldp, http, mdns, dns

Thermostats → dhcp, arp, http, cloud, dns, ntp

Use realistic hostnames and vendor_class_id values per vendor

Vary traffic_interval between 60-300 seconds for realism

Use IP addresses in the 192.168.207.X range starting from .50

Output format: Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema:

{
"network": {
"gateway": "192.168.207.1"
},
"devices": [
{
"id": "vendor_devicetype_01",
"name": "Device Model Name",
"vendor": "Vendor Name",
"type": "Device Category",
"mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff",
"ip_start": "192.168.207.50",
"protocols": ["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "cloud", "dns"],
"enabled": true,
"traffic_interval": 180,
"description": "Vendor Device Model Name - Device Category",
"fingerprint": {
"dhcp": {
"hostname": "device-hostname",
"vendor_class_id": "Vendor Device Model",
"client_id_type": 1,
"param_req_list":
​
}
}
}
]
}

Reference example (copy this structure exactly):

{
"id": "hikvis_security_cameras_01",
"name": "Hikvision DS-2CD2385FWD-I",
"vendor": "Hikvision",
"type": "Security Camera",
"mac": "00:12:34:14:00:14",
"ip_start": "192.168.207.70",
"protocols": ["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "http", "rtsp", "cloud", "dns", "ntp"],
"enabled": true,
"traffic_interval": 242,
"description": "Hikvision DS-2CD2385FWD-I - Security Cameras",
"fingerprint": {
"dhcp": {
"hostname": "DS-2CD2385FWD-I",
"vendor_class_id": "HIKVISION",
"client_id_type": 1,
"param_req_list":

}
}
}

Important DHCP fingerprint guidelines per device type:

Cameras (Hikvision, Axis, Dahua): param_req_list should include (with NTP option 42)

Smart Lighting (Philips Hue, LIFX, TP-Link): param_req_list or with NTP
​

Sensors (Xiaomi, Aqara, Samsung): param_req_list
​

Thermostats (Nest, Ecobee, Honeywell): param_req_list (with MTU option 26)
​

Printers (HP, Canon): param_req_list (with domain search option 119)
​

Smart Speakers (Amazon Echo, Google Home): param_req_list (Echo) or (Google)
​

MAC OUI prefixes to use:

Philips: ec:b5:fa

Hikvision: 00:12:34

TP-Link: 50:c7:bf

Xiaomi: 4c:65:a8

Samsung: d0:52:a8

Axis: 00:40:8c

Sonoff: 34:94:54

Shelly: c4:5b:be

Arlo: d0:73:d5

Google: 18:b4:30

Amazon: 50:f5:da

Now generate the complete JSON file with [NUMBER] devices.

- `[NUMBER]`: How many devices you need (recommended: 50-100)

### Step 3: Generate the JSON

1. Paste the customized prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
2. Wait for the LLM to generate the complete JSON
3. Copy the generated JSON output

### Step 4: Import into Your App

1. Open your SD-WAN Traffic Generator dashboard
2. Navigate to "Configuration" or "Import"
3. Paste the JSON into the import field
4. Click "Validate" to check syntax

## Validation and Testing

After generating your JSON file, validate it before importing:

### 1. JSON Syntax Validation

```bash
# Install jq if not already installed
# macOS: brew install jq
# Linux: apt-get install jq

# Validate JSON syntax
jq . iot-devices.json
2. Check for Duplicate MAC Addresses
bash
# List all MACs and find duplicates
jq -r '.devices[].mac' iot-devices.json | sort | uniq -d

# If output is empty, no duplicates ✅
3. Verify All Devices Have Fingerprints
bash
# List devices missing DHCP fingerprints
jq -r '.devices[] | select(.fingerprint.dhcp == null) | .id' iot-devices.json

# If output is empty, all devices have fingerprints ✅
4. Check IP Address Range
bash
# List all IPs to verify they're in correct range
jq -r '.devices[].ip_start' iot-devices.json | sort -V

# Should be sequential from 192.168.207.50 onwards
5. Verify Protocol Assignments
bash
# List devices by type and their protocols
jq -r '.devices[] | "\(.type): \(.protocols | join(", "))"' iot-devices.json | sort -u
Tips for Best Results
1. Be Specific About Industry Context
The more details you provide, the better the LLM can select appropriate devices:

❌ Too vague: "Generate 50 devices"

✅ Better: "Generate 50 devices for a water utility company including SCADA, meters, and sensors"

2. Request Vendor Diversity
Mix premium and budget brands for realism:

text
Include a mix of:
- Premium vendors (Axis cameras, Philips lighting, GE Healthcare)
- Mid-range vendors (TP-Link, Ubiquiti, Dahua)
- Budget IoT (Sonoff, Xiaomi, Shelly)
3. Specify Realistic Quantities
Per device type, suggest realistic counts:

text
- 3-5 Hikvision cameras for parking/lobby
- 10-15 Philips Hue lights across floors
- 20-30 Xiaomi sensors (doors, motion, temperature)
- 2-3 HP printers per floor
4. Use OUI Patterns
The prompt includes correct MAC OUI prefixes, but you can emphasize:

text
Ensure MAC addresses use correct vendor OUI prefixes:
- Philips devices must start with ec:b5:fa
- Hikvision must start with 00:12:34
- TP-Link must start with 50:c7:bf
5. Iterate and Refine
If the first generation isn't perfect:

text
The output looks good, but please:
- Replace all Xiaomi sensors with Aqara (same OUI: 54:ef:44)
- Add 5 more Axis cameras (OUI: 00:40:8c)
- Reduce TP-Link bulbs from 15 to 8
Common Issues and Solutions
Issue: Duplicate MAC Addresses
Solution: Ask the LLM to regenerate with:

text
Please ensure all MAC addresses are unique. Use sequential addresses within each vendor's OUI range.
Issue: Unrealistic Device Mix
Solution: Provide more specific counts:

text
Generate exactly:
- 10 cameras
- 20 sensors
- 15 smart lights
- 10 smart plugs
- 5 thermostats
Issue: Missing Fingerprints
Solution: Emphasize in prompt:

text
CRITICAL: Every device MUST include a complete fingerprint.dhcp object with hostname, vendor_class_id, and param_req_list.
Issue: Wrong Protocols
Solution: Specify protocols per type:

text
Cameras MUST have: dhcp, arp, lldp, http, rtsp, cloud, dns, ntp
Sensors MUST have: dhcp, arp, mqtt, cloud, dns
Do not add protocols that are not supported (snmp, https).
