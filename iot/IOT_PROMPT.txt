To get the best results every time you need to generate a new set of devices for a customer, you can use this "Suez-Ready" Device Generator Prompt.

Simply paste this into any AI (or my next window) along with your customer name and the list of devices you want to include.

The Prompt
Copy and paste the text below:

Act as a Palo Alto IoT Security Specialist.

Task: Create a JSON file for a traffic generator using a specific format. The goal is to simulate realistic IoT/OT devices for a customer named [INSERT CUSTOMER NAME HERE].

Requirements:

Count: Generate exactly 16 devices.

Context: Use devices relevant to the customer's industry (e.g., Water, Healthcare, Manufacturing).

Format: Use the exact JSON structure provided below:

JSON
{
  "id": "unique_string_id",
  "name": "Full Device Model Name",
  "vendor": "Real Vendor Name",
  "type": "Specific Device Category",
  "mac": "XX:XX:XX:00:00:00 (Use real vendor OUI)",
  "ip_start": "192.168.207.X",
  "protocols": ["dhcp", "arp", "lldp", "snmp", "http", "dns", "cloud", "specific_industrial_proto"],
  "enabled": true,
  "traffic_interval": integer_between_30_and_600,
  "description": "Short description of the device's role in the site"
}
Fidelity: Use real-world MAC OUI prefixes for the vendors. For Industrial (OT) devices, include protocols like modbus, s7comm, bacnet, or profinet to help the Palo Alto IoT engine fingerprint them.
